# Crypto4Fun-SwiftUI

In this project you'll find how I made async api call, view extractions, use AsyncImage for display image from URL, and see how I'm using [Crypto4FunKit](https://github.com/Harry-KNIGHT/Crypto4FunKit)

All the project is made in SwiftUI with [Nyl Neuville](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyl-neuville-427372210/).

I made the [UIKit version](https://github.com/Harry-KNIGHT/Crypto4FunUIKit)
